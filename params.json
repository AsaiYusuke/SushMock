{"name":"SushMock","tagline":"","body":"# SushMock - Secure Shell Mock testing\r\n\r\n- Author : Asai Yusuke\r\n- Created: Jan 4, 2016\r\n- Project Status: **This project is alpha version now. Basic functions began to work.**\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nSushMock is a simple standalone testing tool for stubbing and mocking SSH communications.\r\nIt consists of two functions. Record and Simulate.\r\n- Record Mode\r\nInstall between the network of up to real server , and capture data.\r\n- Simulate Mode\r\nNo real server needs. Simulates communications using recorded data.\r\n\r\n# Key Features\r\n\r\n- Recording to data files for all communications of standard input/output/error.\r\n- Simulate communications using recorded data files.\r\n- Extensions allows raw data transform.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n1. Download SushMock.jar\r\n2. Execute JavaVM\r\n```sh\r\njava -jar SushMock.jar -h\r\nusage: SushMockServer [options]\r\n[options]\r\n    --buffer-size <size>     set the history buffer size [10485760]\r\n    --data <data-dir>        set the mock data directory [data]\r\n    --extensions <classes>   set the extension class names\r\n -h,--help                   display this help\r\n    --listen-port <port>     set the listen port number [22]\r\n    --mode <mode>            set the execution mode [Simulate]\r\n    --remote-host <host>     set the remote server hostname or ip address\r\n                             [192.168.1.1]\r\n    --remote-port <port>     set the remote server port number [22]\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n\r\n- SSH client can't use hmac-sha2-512 algorithm\r\nThis is a problem of Apache MINA that SushMock is using the SSH connection\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nApache License Version 2.0.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
